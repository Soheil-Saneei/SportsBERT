SportsBERT, similar to finBERT, is a transformer model designed to analyze the sentiment of sports headlines. However, unlike finBERT, this model has not been trained on data and attempts online have no resulted in accurate models. In this repository we attempt to train and modify the model to accurately gauge the sentiment of sports headlines. This could become a great tool for sports analysis.
